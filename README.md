# What is $dETH?

dETH is a reflection token that utilizes the IterableMapping Library in conjunction with a custom ERC20 implementation to track/pay out dividends to holders. While $dETH is a single token, dividends are tracked by another one, which are burned and minted according to exclusions. 

dETH has three different fees that it can implement:
Auto LP: Create and send LP tokens to a specified address
Team/Marketing Fee: Send ETH directly to a team controlled walelt
Reflection: Deposit ETH directly into holders wallets passively
